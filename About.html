<h2 class="me">RW front-end developer, based in Africa</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
I am a young leader who is very passionate about helping and empowering others, especially women, and that's among many
reasons I like to study and learn many different things. Where for now, I can say that I am into drawing, programming,
and wildlife conservation, and I also studied science(chemistry and biology). I need to be empowered, and shecodes has
helped me so far to bring me into the world of coding. I am confident to say that there are some things I can teach in
programming.
